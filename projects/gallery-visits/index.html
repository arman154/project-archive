            <h3>1.	The name of the artist that made this piece is “Isak Kingelez”. 
                The piece itself is named “Congolese” and it was created in 1991. I 
                wanted to document myself at this piece because it stopped me while 
                I was walking by it and no other artwork had done that until I saw 
                this one. I was drawn to it because of its massive size and all the 
                different colors it had. The composition reminded me of a busy city. 
                The line marks resembled movement and so do the strips of light. The 
                strips of light especially reminded me of cars moving at night in 
                Manhattan and the sharp line marks seem to be all moving towards one 
                point almost like how avenues look in Manhattan as well. This is 
                probably the main the reason I was so attracted to this artwork, 
                because there are so many subtle hints to city life and movement 
                much like NYC.

                <h3> 2.	This artwork was made by “Alex Katz”. It is named “Upside Down 
                            Ada” and it was created in 1965. I was drawn to this piece because of 
                            its use of color and the materials used. This piece is only made out of 
                            oil on canvas which is rare for being in MOMA. Most of the other pieces 
                            are some kind of cool instillation or crazy metal statue. I am also a huge 
                            fan or traditional paintings which is also why I really liked seeing this 
                            at the MOMA. The placement of this piece was also by the restrooms and a 
                            staircase that also had chairs, so this was the only piece that I had 
                            a moment to actually sit down and look at for a long period of time which 
                            made me like it even more.

                 <h3> 3. The artist of this metal sculpture is named “Gyula Kosice”. It is named 
                     “Articulated Mobile Sculpture” and it is made out of brass. I really liked this 
                     piece because in the description I read that this artwork is meant to be manipulated 
                     by the viewer. I thought that this idea of the artist was so interesting to allow the 
                     viewer to have a say in the artwork. This piece is also very eye catching for its simplicity 
                     and posture. I also read in the description that this artwork’s looks very shiny and 
                     expensively made but it’s actually made from everyday materials that have been 
                     heavily polished.

                    <h3>4.	This piece is named “Neumann Vibration-Writing”. It was created by a man named “Jesus 
                            Rafael Soto” in the year 1964. I really liked this piece because it played eyes while I 
                            walked by it. There are strings placed in front of and illustration that has carefully 
                            placed on it as well, so that when you walk by it the vertical lines play tricks with your 
                            eyes almost like and effect in the Adobe program Premiere Pro. I enjoy using this program 
                            a lot which is why I also really liked this piece. To me it almost felt like one of these 
                            effects had come to life and I was watching it in real time.

                <h3> 5.	The last piece of work that I documented was by and artist named “Yves Tanguy”. His was is 
                    named “Slowly Toward the North” and it was created in 1942. I really like this artwork because 
                    it reminded me a lot of Salvador Dali’s work. It had a scene of realism and a twist of modernism 
                    all in the same composition. There also vibration color combinations that really complement each 
                    other well. There is also a great sense of depth that makes the viewer feel that they are on a wide 
                    desert plane of some kind only by using two colors in a very subtle way. All of these different elements 
                    were put together in a very interesting way by this artist which made me attracted to it.
